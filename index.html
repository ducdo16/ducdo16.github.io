    <div class="container qanda">
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br> Great topic! What inspired you to choose this subject for discussion?</div>
        <div class="width40 sans"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br> Uhm I just wanted to have someone to openly share about my recent encounter with burnout regarding my graduation project.  </div>
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br> Got it! Can you tell me when did that burnout happen and what could have prompted you to feeling that way? </div>
        <div class="width40 sans"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>It happened just recently when I was in my final semester of university, specifically a few last weeks before my graduation project submission. 

            In terms of reasons, I think that has something to do with how I felt <span class="highlight sans">insecure</span>  and <span class="highlight sans">confused</span> with where this project was going. </div>
        <div class="width25 sans">
            <div class="icon"> <img src="drink1.png" alt=""></div>
            AI<br>I am so sorry to hear that. Are there any specific instances that you can think of to best underline the intensity of the situation?</div>
        <div class="width40 sans"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>Yes, there were numerous times when I felt like <span class="highlight sans">giving up</span> . As the deadline for my graduation project drew near, I <span class="highlight sans">struggled</span>  and felt <span class="highlight sans">uninspired</span>.
            With the <span class="highlight sans">time pressure</span> , I had to push ahead with my <span class="highlight sans">incomplete</span>  work. I began to <span class="highlight sans">doubt</span> whether I was cut out to be a graphic designer.</div>
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br>(sighs) How has this deadline impacted you both mentally and physically?</div>
        <div class="width40 sans"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>Throughout the project, I consistently stayed up very late to do work. There were days that I did not get a single sleep. 

            I have never encountered a burnout like this before. I was having a <span class="highlight sans">major breakout</span> on my face, leaving me feel very <span class="highlight sans">insecure</span> and <span class="highlight sans">sad</span>. 
            
            Days after days, I soon gave in to <span class="highlight sans">bad habits</span> that I have tried to give up for months. </div>
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br>(empathizes) I'm really sorry to hear that! It's completely normal to feel a little down when things don't go as you expected. I am just going to ask you a few questions before I start making your drink. How did you cope with the situation?</div>
        <div class="width40"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>Well, I managed to submit my final project on time. I plan to make some <span class="highlight sans">revisions</span>  after the submission and include it in my portfolio later. I've learned to enhance my <span class="highlight sans">time management skills</span> and, most importantly, to remind myself that I am <span class="highlight sans">capable</span> and <span class="highlight sans">competent</span>. During the project, I felt quite <span class="highlight sans">insecure</span> , which made me <span class="highlight sans">discouraged</span> and tempted to give up.</div>
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br>After all, what lessons did you learn from it?</div>
        <div class="width40"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>It's a tough lesson to learn, but I recognize that <span class="highlight sans">changes</span> are <span class="highlight sans">necessary</span>. I see this as a milestone, as I've gained insight into my strengths and weaknesses, and how I can use them to my advantage in future projects.</div>
        <div class="width25 sans">AI<br>I'm really glad to hear that! How do you feel at this moment after everything you've experienced?</div>
        <div class="width40 sans"></div>
        <div class="width33 sans">Ken<br>I'm definitely feeling <span class="highlight sans">better</span> now that I've completed all my assessments. At this point, I'm <span class="highlight sans">hopeful</span>  that I'll put in <span class="highlight sans">200% effort</span> into my revisions to present on project exhibition day.
